## Fullstack TypeScript React Apps in Minutes. Stop configuring, start coding.

[Documentation](/docs/docs/getting_started.md)

## For maintainers

Create a .env file in the root of the project.
Set the following values:

```
DEV_PROJECT_PATH=path/to/a/cantara/project
DEV_CANTARA_COMMAND=dev app-x
```

Set `DEV_PROJECT_PATH` to a path of a Cantara project. Use `DEV_CANTARA_COMMAND` to simulate a command.
Now run `npm start` to start the development.
