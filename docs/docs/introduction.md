# ...and what problems does it solve?

Cantara stands for: **C**reate **A** **N**ode, **T**ypeScript **A**nd **R**eact **A**pplication

It is a **zero-config** tool for developing (one or more) React Applications with one or more Serverless endpoints **or** NodeJS APIs, organized in a Monorepository, using TypeScript on all layers of the stack.

It also makes it easy to share code between layers or to external consumers as packages, which can be used internally or from the outside using NPM.

**So essentially a tool to make Fullstack TypeScript app development a joy. Stop configuring, start coding.**

## With Cantara you can:

- Develop client side React Apps (like you can do with Create React App)
- Develop and deploy serverless APIs
- Develop NodeJS applications (e.g. an express based REST API)
- Develop React Components/JS packages, use them in your application and publish them to NPM
- Develop unit/integration/e2e tests

...all of it using TypeScript in every part of stack without _ever_ dealing with Webpack, TSConfig, Jest or whatever tool is needed in that complex workflow again.

But Cantara isn't only _exclusively_ for Fullstack TypeScript apps, it's also very useful if only need one feature, e.g. developing and publishing React Components (never touching that sketchy webpack config again, huh ðŸ˜…).

Despite it's **zero-config** nature, Cantara aims to be highly customizable, it shouldn't be in your way but adapt to the very specific needs of your project which may arise over time. There is no such thing as _ejecting_, if you want to change the internal behaviour of Cantara, you can do that through special hooks (**\***). Like that, you don't loose the many advantages of re-using the same configurations across multiple repositories.

So, if you are developing Micro Frontends, a React-based dashboard, an UI library for your company, a scalable serverless API for your SaaS or all of that combined, Cantara _may_ be right for you.

**\*** Note: This is yet to be implemented, as it is better to implement such a rather complex interface with as much community feedback as possible, to serve the different needs best. In the mean time, please open an issue with the feature you are missing. That would be a great help!

## Next steps

Enough talking, let's get started:

- [Go to the Quick Start guide to see how can get up and running with a Fullstack TypeScript project within 5 minutes](quick_start).
- [You can also directly dive deeper and head over to the **Docs**, which cover every aspect of Cantara](glossary)
