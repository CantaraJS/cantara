## What you are going to learn

- **Testing with Jest**
- **Environment variables**

- **Executing arbitrary commands for apps/packages**
- **E2E/Integration testing with Cypress**

## Glossary

Just so that we are all on the same page, let's clarify what some words mean in the context of Cantara.

- **App** or **Application**: When refering to an app, either a NodeJS application or a serverless endpooint under `/node-apps` or a React app under `/react-app` can be meant.

Ready? Ok, so let's dive into that!
