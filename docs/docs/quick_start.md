# Installing and getting ready

Install Cantara globally using your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm i -g cantara
```

Now you can access Cantara in the command line using one of those aliases:

```bash
cantara
ctra
# For examle
ctra dev my-app
```

# Initializing a new project

Now let's get you a new folder on your Computer!
To kickstart a new Cantara project, use the [`init`](commands/init) command.
By default, the cantara-simple-starter template is used. You can find other templates on the [official list of starter templates](starter_templates) or specify a link to another git repository as the last parameter.

```bash
ctra init my-awesome-project
```

This will create a new folder `my-awesome-project`.

Now, let's go to that folder.

```bash
cd my-awesome-project
```
