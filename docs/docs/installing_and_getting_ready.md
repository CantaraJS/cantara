Install cantara globally using your favorite package manager.

```bash
npm i -g cantara
```

Now you can access Cantara in the command line using one of those aliases:

```bash
cantara
ctra
```

When you execute Cantara without parameters, an easy to use wizard will prompt you with all the commands you can currently invoke.

This applies to all commands! Throughout the docs we will always refer to the full commands.

**Examples**:

```bash
# Without wizard
ctra dev my-app
# With wizard
ctra
# OR
ctra dev
```
