## Glossary

Just so that we are all on the same page, let's clarify what some words mean in the context of Cantara.

- **App** or **Application**: When refering to an app, either a NodeJS application or a serverless endpoint under `/node-apps` or a React app under `/react-app` can be meant.
- **Package** always refers to packages under the `/packages` folder

Ready? Ok, so let's dive more deeply into Cantara!
