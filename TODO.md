# TODO

## Required

- Re-do 5h of work which was accidently deleted :angry:
  - Building React Components / JS Packages
    - Common React config
    - index.js -> src
- Write somewhat complete docs
- Talk to CD try to integrate Cantara into their current workflow
  - Find out if tool is good enough for deployment needs
  - Customization needs? e.g. extending wepback/babel/TS config etc
- Implement Novitas Auth with Cantara and use it in Photogram
  - Write good docs for other developers
- Port Photogram Codebase to Cantara
- Write integration tests for CLI

## Nice to have

- Add bundleanalyzer option to build cmd
- Replace Nodemon with custom Chokidar implementation
- When new version is available, show message.
